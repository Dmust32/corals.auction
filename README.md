# corals.auction

This is a personal project of mine. This site is essentially an auction site for coral for saltwater aquarium enthusiasts.

It is built using the React.js library, Node.js with an Express server and SQL with a database hosted on Heroku.

I have also utilized Amazon S3 for image hosting.
